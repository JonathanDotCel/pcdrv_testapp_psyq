Psx CPE2X - Win32 Version by Orion_ [2013]

This is a replacement for the cpe2x.com and cpe2exe.exe Psx tools.
Both of these tools are 16bits and doesn't run on modern OS such as Windows 7 64bits.
I found some old C source on web.archive.org, the source wasn't compiling so I corrected some things.
And now you have a new cpe2x tool working on modern OS !

This tool convert a cpe file from psxlinker to a PS-EXE file.
It also roundup the exe size to 2048, and sign the header. (so you won't need to use exefixup)

Usage: exactly as the original cpe2x: cpe2x file.cpe

The original source have no author mentionned, maybe Nagra/Blackvision ?
